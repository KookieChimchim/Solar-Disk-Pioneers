      <h4 class="sun1">The sun has been quite a mystery and topic of research since the young days of the space race. Many spacecrafts either tried or somewhat helped in knowing the sun better as of now.</h4>
<h4> 1960 to 1969 NASA launched 6 pioneer spacecrafts orbiter types out of which 5 are considered successfull 5 of the 6 were launched in the later part of decade spacecrafts being pioneer 5, 6A , 7B , 8C , 9D, E out of these pioneer 5 being the first launched measured magnetic field phenomena , solar flare particles  , ionization in the planetary region over the course of 1965 to 1968 4 successfull pioneer missions were launched to study network of solar - orbiting "space weather" monitors , observing solar wind , cosmic rays and magnetic fields in 1969- The year when mankind made a giant leap to the Moon- was the failure in Solar Mission Pioneer E which intended to be a part of pioneer 6-9 network but it failed to reach the orbit.</h4>

<h4>2nd wave of solar missions started from 1974 to 1997 during this period 7 spacecrafts were launched all being orbiter types. This was the first time some other space agency colaborated with NASA on solar probes helios series of solar probes helios a and helios b was a collaborated project of nasa and german space agency dfvlr they both were a success and took observations of solar winds , magnetic and electric fields , cosmic rays and cosmic dusts between Earth and Sun.</h4>

<h4>ISEE -3 NASA Loner Orbital Mission in 1978 was also a success which observed solar phenomena in conjunction with earth-orbiting ISEE-1 and ISEE-2; later renamed International Cometary Explorer (ICE) and directed to Comet Giacobini-Zinner ISEE-1 and ISEE-2 remained near the Earth. ISEE-3 was the first spacecraft to be placed in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun Lagrangian points L1 and it was later launched into a heliocentric orbit.next in series was a nasa esa collaborative Ulysses which was a 3 pass orbiter program with 3 passes spreade over course of time first pass from 1994 and 1995 which made south and north polar observations in respective years same happened in the second and third pass that is 2000 and 2001 for 2nd pass and 2007 and 2008 for the 3rd it was a huge success as it gave key information of Ulysses’ principal findings included data that showed there is a weakening of the solar wind over time (which was at a 50-year low in 2008).</h4>
<h4> From the mission indicated the solar magnetic field at the Sun's poles is much weaker than previously assumed.
Ulysses helped determine that the Sun’s magnetic field “reverses” in direction every 11 years.
The spacecraft's May 1996 encounter with comet Hyakutake revealed comet tails are far longer than expected but the 3rd pass north polar observations could be considered a partial success as only some data returned despite failing power and reduced transmission capacity.</h4>
<h4> Next in line would be WIND mission by nasa in 1994 which is still operating and is said to have enough fuel for another 50 years to operate and observe the solar wind measurements. The soho mission collaborative of nasa and esa  in 1996 meant to be 2 year mission was still extended to dec 2020 which has likely been extended to 2022 its a successfull mission conductig investigatation of sun's core , corona and solar wind and comet discoveries as well the next in line nasa ace mission launched in 1997 projected until 2024 orbit mission meant to observe solar wind was also a success</h4>

<h4> Genesis mission in 2001 the first orbiter ass well as sample return misssion was more than partial success as it brought back solar wind samples but crash landed on return to earth which infact caused salvaging of much data. The next in series was the stero series which consisted of stereo a and b both are considered as successfull orbiter missions launched in 2006. They were meant to provide stereoscopic imaging of coronal mass ejections and other solar phenomena however, stereo B lost communication in late 2014 but stero a is still active in the space now talking about some farely recent missions DSCVR orbiter mission by nooa launched in 2015 is a success which is monitoring on solar wind and coronal mass ejection while monitoring earth climate as well it proudly stays in the space too. The next would the parker solar probe which is an orbiter / flyby spacecraft by nasa that will make 26 approaches to the sun which is currently on route and its cuurent status is healthy and operating as designed following its fourth close approach to the Sun, called perihelion, on Jan. 29. 2021 parker solar probe will conduct close range solar coronal study. You can read about parker solar probe in detail on our website. Last but not the least Esa launched the solar orbiter spacecraft which is an orbiter type sspacecraft in Feb 2020 which is on route and will take approximately 3.5 years, using repeated gravity assists from Earth and Venus, to reach its operational orbit and it is meant to study solar heliosphere.
There is also an orbiter type spaceprobe Aditya L1 which is planned to launch in January 2022 by none other than ISRO, it will also study about the solar corona</h4>
